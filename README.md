## 1. Problem Statement

They're able to test out new ideas and behaviors in a comfortable environment. Dress-up encourages creative thinking and communication skills.

Playing imaginitive games online can bring more variety to a kid's play, and help them become familiar with using a computer in a fun way.  Online games can be more accessible than physical play depending on a person's situation.

## 2. Technical Solution

Create an application for dressing up a character, and allow users to post outfits and get inspiration from others.

### Scenario 1
Sara is tired of playing dress-up by herself.  She wants to play with new clothes and show her outfits to her friends.  Her parents don't want her to use social media where she could be easily identified, because she is still young.  She plays Dress-Up Duck and tries new clothes on a new character.  She gets to be creative in a new way, in a safe environment.  She can post her outfits and communicate with others about their outfits.

### Scenario 2
Hance likes playing computer games and seeing different art styles.  He especially likes games with animals.  He plays Dress-Up Duck to see how it compares to other online games, and decides to keep his outfits to himself because he doesn't feel like reading comments or making comments.
