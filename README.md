# Dev10 Capstone
This was the final project assigned as part of the Dev10 training. Here are the assignment details:

## Introduction
Use everything you've learned in this course to design, implement, and test a database-backed application with an HTML user interface delivered via HTTP. The Java Capstone assessment is an open-ended project in which you (and your teammates) are responsible for every decision.

You must decide:
- the topic or domain of your application (What problem does it solve?)
- appropriate technologies (Do you build your UI with React or something else?)
- application architecture (Are the front-end and back-end separate projects? [They are.] Do you need something more or different than the course layers and - patterns?)
- development strategy from planning to testing (When you say that you're 60% complete, how do you know?)

## Team
Aysha, Gabrielle, and Livia

## Project: Dress-Up Duck
A dress-up game, but the character you dress is a duck. You can post outfits you created, and comment on other posts. The learning goal was to incorporate SVGs and GreenSock.
